OS X Screensaver - Draws Random Graphs. Based on memories of an ancient (Mac OS 7 era) screensaver named GraphicStat.

A binary StatGrapher.saver.tgz is available in the releases section. Extract this and double-click on the StatGrapher.saver package to install. You may need to ctrl-right-click + open to get around the OS X installation security policy. Mountain Lion or later is probably required.

You can change the text that is used in the graph headings. Create a text file named:

```
~/Library/Application\ Support/com.apple.systempreferences/statgrapher_words
```

The format is line-oriented with 4 sections delimited by the section number enclosed in asterisks.
